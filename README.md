# Web-Design-Challenge

## Data Science BootCamp Homework Submission
## Due September 14, 2021

In this homework, we were to design a web-based report that contains data given to us (one csv file and 4 images). This submission contains:

1. index_3.html -- the main landing page
2. style_index.css -- style page
3. HTML folder
  - This folder contains visualizations (MaxTemp.html, Cloudiness.html, WindSpeed.html, Humidity.html), Comparison page (Comparison.html), Data page (Data.html), and a Jupyter Notebook that I used to convert csv file into html format. 
4. Resources folder that contains data given to us
